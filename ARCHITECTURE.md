# 🧠 System Architecture Overview

The Regenerative Earth Project aims to build a transparent intelligence system that converts environmental data into regenerative development recommendations.

The system is designed around four primary layers.

---

# 1. Data Acquisition Layer

This layer gathers open environmental datasets.

Potential sources include:

- Satellite imagery
- Climate datasets
- Soil classification maps
- Elevation and terrain models
- Hydrology data
- Biodiversity databases

Example data providers may include organizations such as:

- NASA Earth observation datasets
- global climate databases
- open geospatial mapping platforms

Data ingestion components will standardize and store environmental data for analysis.

# 2. Environmental Analysis Layer

This layer interprets environmental conditions.

Core analyses may include:

Climate Analysis
- rainfall patterns
- seasonal variation
- temperature range

Terrain Analysis
- slope
- flood risk
- erosion potential

Water Availability
- groundwater potential
- surface water
- rainfall harvesting potential

Soil Analysis
- soil type
- drainage
- agricultural suitability

Vegetation Analysis
- natural plant ecosystems
- potential crops
- forest restoration opportunities

---

# 3. Regenerative Intelligence Layer

This is the reasoning layer of the platform.

Using environmental analysis, the system generates possible strategies for:

Water Systems
- wells
- rainwater harvesting
- water storage

Shelter
- natural building methods
- locally available materials

Food Systems
- crop suggestions
- agroforestry
- soil regeneration

Energy
- small-scale renewable options

All recommendations must include:

- reasoning
- environmental justification
- safety considerations
- uncertainty indicators

The system provides decision support, not instructions.

---

# 4. Output & User Interface Layer

The final layer translates analysis into accessible outputs.

Possible formats include:

- Human-readable reports
- Visual diagrams
- Infrastructure plans
- Step-by-step guidance
- Downloadable documents

The platform should prioritize clarity and simplicity for communities with limited technical resources.

---

# Design Principles

The architecture follows several key principles:

Transparency  
All algorithms and reasoning must be auditable.

Explainability  
Users must understand why a recommendation was generated.

Local Feasibility  
Solutions must prioritize locally available resources.

Safety  
Recommendations must avoid harmful or unsafe practices.

Ecological Regeneration  
All solutions should strengthen ecosystems over time.

# Future Considerations

Potential future capabilities include:

- Regional knowledge models
- Indigenous knowledge integration
- Offline system deployments
- Community collaboration tools

The architecture will evolve as contributors and domain experts join the project.
