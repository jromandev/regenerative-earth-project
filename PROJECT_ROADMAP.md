# 🌍 The Regenerative Earth Project – Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of the platform.  
It is expected to evolve as contributors and experts join the project.

The long-term goal is to create an open intelligence system capable of generating regenerative development strategies based on local environmental conditions.

---

# Phase 0 — Foundation (Current)

Goal: Establish the ethical, organizational, and technical foundations.

Tasks:

- Publish manifesto and mission documents
- Create open GitHub repository
- Define governance and stewardship model
- Establish contribution guidelines
- Draft technical architecture

Outputs:

- Public repository
- Core documentation
- Contributor onboarding

---

# Phase 1 — Minimal Viable Platform

Goal: Build a basic system that analyzes a geographic location and generates a preliminary regenerative plan.

Core features:

- Input: Latitude and Longitude
- Retrieve environmental datasets
- Analyze:

  - Climate patterns
  - Soil type
  - Terrain
  - Water availability

- Generate initial recommendations for:

  - Water collection
  - Shelter location
  - Basic crop selection

Output:

- Simple report
- Human-readable explanation of reasoning

---

# Phase 2 — Expanded Environmental Intelligence

Goal: Improve analysis depth and reliability.

New capabilities:

- Hydrology analysis
- Biodiversity mapping
- Vegetation classification
- Natural building material identification
- Regenerative agriculture strategies

Outputs may include:

- Rainwater harvesting designs
- Well placement guidance
- Natural building methods
- Agroforestry strategies
- Soil regeneration plans

---

# Phase 3 — Local Resource Intelligence

Goal: Identify locally accessible materials and tools.

The system will begin identifying:

- Stone
- Clay
- Timber
- Bamboo
- Natural fibers
- Plant-based materials

Possible outputs:

- Local construction techniques
- Tool fabrication strategies
- Traditional building approaches
- Repairable infrastructure designs

---

# Phase 4 — Community Planning Systems

Goal: Support broader settlement development.

Capabilities may include:

- Village-scale water systems
- Land restoration planning
- Food forest design
- Micro-renewable energy options
- Waste and nutrient cycles

---

# Phase 5 — Offline & Low-Connectivity Access

Many communities with the greatest need lack reliable internet access.

Future versions may support:

- Offline data packages
- Downloadable regional datasets
- Printable infrastructure plans
- Lightweight local deployments

---

# Long-Term Vision

A global open platform that:

- Helps communities design regenerative infrastructure
- Amplifies indigenous and local knowledge
- Supports ecological restoration
- Strengthens human resilience without dependency

This is not a short-term project.

It is a generational effort.
